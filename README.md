Redmine Per-tracker Issue Categories plugin
=======================

Redmine categories are set for the whole project. What if these categories should only apply to one specific tracker?

This plugin allows you to specify trackers for each category.
With a shorter category list, the issue form is cleaner and it helps the user to avoid mistakes.

Installation
------------

This plugin has been tested with Redmine 3.3+.

Note that this plugin now depends on:

* **redmine_base_deface** which can be found [here](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_deface)
