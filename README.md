Redmine Per-tracker Issue Categories plugin
=======================

Redmine issue categories let you organize issues. Being able to auto-assign new issues to a specific user based on the chosen category is great.

But these categories are set for the whole project.
What if these categories should apply to one specific tracker?

This plugin allows you to specify a tracker for each category.
Making the issue category list shorter, the issue form is cleaner and it helps the user to avoid mistakes.
